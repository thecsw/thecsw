Call me Sandy. Some moons ago - no clue how or when exactly - having no last-minute assignments left to do, and projects, in particular, to obsess with, I thought I would make a simple website and explore the world of writing. It is a way I use to interact with the world and express myself. Whenever I find myself needing to share something; whenever it is good a time, revolutionary March in my soul; whenever I find myself trying out new tech; and especially whenever my curiosity overshadows the other me, that it requires an Aristotelian virtue to prevent me from sinking all my time, and methodically ignoring every other commitment in life - then, I consider it to be the moment of truth.
