### Hey everyone! 🖖 This is Sandy

I guess I found a secret, _ooooh_. This is exciting! Isn't? The freedom to put anything here. Absolutely anything!

I'll try to make this short and sweet like your first love. I like doing stuff that I like doing. I've been programming since I was 12, my first language was Pascal in Pascal **TURBO** 🚗. I was blown away that I can do math and find quadratic roots with code √

Since then I worked with a swarm of different languages, web frameworks, protocols, and really improved my taste in coffee. I created a reddit bot that allowed people to invest in memes, which inexplicably blew up in popularity. I've been writing automation tools 🔧, joke bots 🃏, cryptography tools 🔑, devops workflows 🌊, etc. 

Over the time I came to some personal understanding of what is happening. No one knows what they are doing. Coding is not about just coding or lines of code, it's about delivering a solution to some problem. Some folks take languages' and editors' differences to even religious extents. Just live life, enjoy and love ❤️
